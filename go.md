- Don't try wait for a metric you expect to be 0. Make another metric which will be non 0 in this scenario, or do something else.
- If you are using mutexes and you have early returns in your function, you need to be careful that you unlock on the early return as well.
- If your code is getting stuck and you are using waitgroups, ensure the number of calls to `wg.Add()` is equivalent to the number of calls to `wg.Done()`.
- Make sure channels have enough capacity for what you expect them to hold / are you sure you want to send to an unbuffered channel?
- Are you looping over a map and expecting the same result every time? Don't
